The idea that hot water can shrink fibroids is not scientifically supported, and it's important to approach such claims with caution. Fibroids are noncancerous growths that develop in the uterus, and their growth is influenced by various factors, including hormonal changes. While heat therapy, like warm baths, can provide temporary relief from symptoms such as pain and discomfort associated with fibroids, it does not have the capability to shrink or eliminate the fibroids themselves. Medical treatments, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgical interventions are typically recommended for managing fibroids. It's crucial for individuals with concerns about fibroids to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information and personalized advice based on their specific health situation.
